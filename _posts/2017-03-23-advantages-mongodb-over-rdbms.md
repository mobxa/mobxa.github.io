#### Overview

  * MongoDB is a cross-platform, document oriented database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.
  * MongoDB works on concept of collection and document.	
	  * Database is a physical container for collections.
	  * Collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is the equivalent of an RDBMS table.
    * Document is a set of key-value pairs. It is the equivalent of a row in RDBMS.
	
#### Advantages of MongoDB over RDBMS

  * MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Each document has the different number of fields, content and size.
  * Structure of a single object is clear.
  * No complex joins.
  * Deep query-ability.
  * Tuning.
  * Ease of scale-out.
  * Conversion/mapping of application objects to database objects not needed.
  * Use internal memory for storing the working set, enable faster access of data.
  
MongoDB is really powerful. If you never use it, just give it a try. And if you have some questions to ask, feel free to ask me.<br />LP Devs.
