Today, I am going to talk about how to build a simple http server in ubuntu using Nodejs and Expressjs. 
If you have not installed Nodejs, please install it or check [this](https://lpdevs.github.io/nodejs/ubuntu/elementary%20os/2017/03/14/installing-nodejs-and-npm-in-linux-from-binaries.html). By now, I am assumming that you have installed Nodejs. Let's start now:
  
* Create new project:
  * Run:
  ```js
  npm init
  ```

  * Then just hit Enter...After that **package.json** file is generated. (Notice: Name can no longer contain capital letters).

* Install **express** module: open Terminal:
  * Run:
  ```js
  npm install --save express
  ```
    
  * Using **--save** to save it as a dependency in the **package.json** file. Then **node_modules** is generated.
    
* Create a new file: **index.js**, write the code like below:
  * Code:
    ```js
    var express = require('express');

    var app = express();
    var port = process.env.port || 8080;

    app.listen(port, function(){
      console.log('The server is listening on port:' + port);
    });
    ``` 
  * This code will create a server which is bound with **localhost** in port **8080**.
    
* Start this server:
  * Run:
  ```js
  node index.js
  ```
    
  * If the console displays log as **The server is listening on port: 8080**, then the server is started successfully.
  * Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). For now, you will receive an error, which is **Cannot GET /**.
  It is because we are never implementing routing for the server.
    
* Routing by adding the below in **index.js**:
  * Adding:
  ```js
  app.get('/', function(req, res){
    console.log('The server is listening on port:' + port + ' and host:' + host);
  });
  ```
    
  * That means when you navigate to the [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), you requested to get '/'. Then the server
    responses by sending **Hello from main page** to your browser. So starting the server again, then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
    You will receive that message.
* For now, you just can access the server from your computer. Because the server is bound with **localhost**. If you want to access the server from other computers in the same network. You must bind it with your **ip address**. So **index.js** must be modified like below:
  ```js
  var express = require('express');

  var app = express();
  var port = process.env.port || 8080;
  var host = '<your_ip>'; // change it with your ip

  app.get('/', function(req, res){
	  res.send('Hello from main page');
  });

  app.listen(port, host, function(){
	  console.log('The server is listening on port:' + port + ' and host:' + host);
  });
  ```
      
  * Start the server again, then navigate to http://<your_ip>:8080. 
      
 OK, it is just simple way to create a server on Ubuntu using Nodejs and Expressjs. If you want to create more complicated server or have some questions, feel free to ask me. I am really happy to help you.<br />LP Devs.
